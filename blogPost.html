And having spent some time i've managed <br> to create correct CMakeLists.txt files for both projects,although i can't tell that it was very <br> straightforwad. <br><br> Lots of examples from the internet didn't work and were way too complx and overloaded in general. <br> Surprisingly, the simplest one turned to be the one from the official Qt documentation - who would've <br> thought as usually it's the other way around. <br><br> Essential thing here is find_package() - I have no idea what black magic it uses to find Qt in my <br> system,but it did find it despite the fact that it is installed in D:\programs\qt\ (not the most <br> common /standard installation path). Most likely it just checks the PATH system variable,because i have <br> D:\programs\qt\5.12.3\msvc2017_64\bin\ there. <br><br>
        When i tried this on Mac OS, the configure command failed,so i had to provide the path to Qt Manually: </p>

                WIN32 is an important flag if you're building a GUI application on windows - without it the build will fail <br> Obviously,you don't need it on Mac OS or Linux. <br><br>
                Note the $(CMake_PROJECT_NAME) construction - that's how you use vraibles in CMake. So instead of <br> writing the name of the project (qt-widgets-cmake) i just refer to the CMAKE_POJECT_NAME <br> variable. And of course you can define your own variables: for instance, i used my variable sources to <br> gather all the source files for add_executable().  </p>
